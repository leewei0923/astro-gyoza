> 有些人，慢慢不联系就疏远了

曾经看到过一个短篇，主人公有个超能力，能看到每个人头顶上的数字，开始他不知道，这个代表什么含义。时间长了，发现：有些人，这个数字很小，还有的数字慢慢逐渐转为0，由此发现规律，数字为0 ，意味着，他们未来不会相遇了。

今天，她的数字为0了。或许不再相遇了。原谅我，用wyq代替。心中曾默念过无数次wyq，在我心中这已经成为了一种符号。出现过，它在我的课本里，在我的书桌上，在我的心里。。。今天，它将不会再出现了。已经删除了，未来某天，有人问我，它代表什么，我还会大大方方的说出来，它的由来。不需要刻意回避。它陪伴了我曾经的青葱岁月。曾经的精神支柱，曾经发誓要保护的人。

我记得，我高中班主任曾经，让我们写给自己未来的三句话，我忘记了其他两句，却忘不了，那一句：如果未来的你还记得wyq，我鼓励你，勇敢去追她吧！高考后，都放下了，忘记了，只是偶尔提起，偶尔想起！今天删除了，这句话，也随之而去了。

删除？

被删除好友了，其实也没多大事。作为反击，我也删除了qq，不想知道你的消息。刚知道这个消息的时候，也是比较失落的，后面想想后，互相无声告别也挺好的。

从来没有想到以这样的方式结束。

我也忘记了，开始的模样。

删除，一别两宽！

再见wyq，再见我的过去，迎接新的未来。她不会再出现在我的脑海了！

Some people gradually drift apart when they stop keeping in touch.

I once read a short story about a protagonist with a superpower—the ability to see numbers above people's heads. At first, he didn't understand what they meant. But over time, he realized a pattern: some people had very small numbers, while others saw their numbers slowly turn to zero. Eventually, he understood—when a person's number reached zero, it meant they would never cross paths again.

Today, her number became zero. Perhaps we will never meet again.

Forgive me for using "wyq" instead. I have silently repeated this name countless times in my heart. To me, it has become a symbol. It appeared in my textbooks, on my desk, in my mind... But today, it will appear no more. It has been erased. One day, if someone asks me what it meant, I will openly share its story. There is no need to avoid it. It was part of my youth, my past—a spiritual anchor, someone I once swore to protect.

I remember my high school homeroom teacher once had us write three sentences to our future selves. I forgot the other two, but I will never forget this one:
"If, in the future, you still remember wyq, I encourage you to go after her bravely!"

After the college entrance exams, I let it go, forgot about it—only occasionally mentioning or recalling it. But today, I deleted it. And with it, that sentence disappears as well.

Deleted?

Being removed from someone's friend list isn’t a big deal. As a counter-response, I deleted QQ too—I didn’t want to see any updates about her. When I first found out, I felt a little lost, but after thinking it over, a silent farewell seems fitting.

I never imagined it would end this way.

I have even forgotten how it all began.

Delete—part ways and find peace.

Goodbye, wyq. Goodbye to my past. Time to embrace a new future. She will no longer cross my mind.

Delete.
